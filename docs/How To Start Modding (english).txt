'' '''In the following first steps needed will be described, in order to be able to begin with the creating of Mods:''' ''


'''1.)''' The game needs to be updated to the 1.28.3E version first.

This can be done directly, there is no need to update to the 1.12.2 version first.

But the first update contains some additional information related to the game.


Upgrade Version 1.12.2 Multi-Lingual Upgrade - 38.5mb - 05.07.04: ftp://downloads.codemasters.com/upgrade/soldiers_euro_upgrade_v1.12.2.zip

Soldiers: Heroes of WWII MP Combat Upgrade (1.28.3E) - 160 Mb - 04.11.04: http://www.codemasters.de/downloads/?getdownload=17306 (Choose a mirror please!)


'''2.)''' A new folder must be created, which will serve as the reference folder for all new Mods.

Into this folder all basic files of the game will be extracted (to do so such programs like [http://www.7-zip.org/ 7-Zip], PowerArchiver, WinZip or WinRAR are needed).

The following steps are needed in the order that they are given below:


'''2. a)''' Create a new folder for reference (e.g. ''C:\SoldiersFiles'').

'''2. b)''' The entire content from the file '''[YourSoldiersInstallationFolder]\game.pak''' must be extracted into the reference folder (in our example ''C:\SoldiersFiles'').

'''2. c)''' The entire content from the file '''[YourSoldiersInstallationFolder]\resource\Patch\1.pat''' must be extracted into the reference folder (in our example ''C:\SoldiersFiles''). 
Files which already exist must be overwritten!

'''2. d)''' The entire content from the file '''[YourSoldiersInstallationFolder]\resource\Patch\2.pat''' must be extracted into the reference folder (in our example ''C:\SoldiersFiles''). 
Files which already exist must be overwritten!

'''2. e)''' The entire content from the file '''[YourSoldiersInstallationFolder]\expansion.pak''' must be extracted into the reference folder (in our example ''C:\SoldiersFiles'').
Files which already exist must be overwritten!

'''2. f)''' The entire content from the file '''[YourSoldiersInstallationFolder]\resource\Patch\3.pat''' must be extracted into the reference folder (in our example ''C:\SoldiersFiles'').
Files which already exist must be overwritten!


From now on no ''*.pak'' or ''*.pat'' files will not be touched any longer.

All the files from the entire game are now stored in the reference folder.

This are the required files, for working with.


'''3.)''' Now a new folder ''mods'' under '''[YourSoldiersInstallationFolder]\mods''' for all the Mods must be created (if it does not already exist).


'''4.)''' Within this folder now one new folder for each Mod under '''[YourSoldiersInstallationFolder]\mods\[YourModName]''' with the name of the Mod must be created.


'''5.)''' Within each Mod folder a file '''[YourSoldiersInstallationFolder]\mods\[YourModName]\info.mod''' must be created.

This file must contain the following:

 {mod
     {name "'''YourModName'''"}
     {desc "'''YourModDescription'''"}
     {version "'''YourModVersion'''"}
 }

The highlighted contents must be adapted accordingly.


'''6.)''' Likewise within each Mod folder a new folder '''[YourSoldiersInstallationFolder]\mods\[YourModName]\resource''' must be created.

In this folder all ''modified'' files from the reference folder will be stored in exactly the same folder structure.

''(The whole game is based on ordinary text files which contains object information with their attributes and values, etc.)''


'''7.)''' As soon as a Mod is finished for testing, it must be activated in the ''MODS'' menu of the game (alternatively such Tools like the ''[[ModChanger]]'' by ''[[User:BratHering|BratHering]]'' or the ''[[ModSwitcher]]'' by ''Rancid'' can be used).
